# Todo list
This is a todo list app. It can be used to create a list of tasks which can each be assigned a project, a priorty, and a due date. The All tasks page displays the tasks in order of creation (most recent at the top), while the Sort by date page displays them by date. The Project view page groups tasks and displays them by project.

## What I learned
* How to install and use date-fns library
* How to attach events to dynamic elements using event delegation
* How to store and retrieve objects with `localStorage`
* How to work with the `Date()` constructor

## Future features to add
Responsiveness, project dropdowns, creating + editing tasks in Project view, notes property for additional details
